# Wine-Quality-Decision_Tree_ML
📊Highlights & Results
🔹Best hyperparameters (via GridSearchCV): e.g., max_depth = 5, min_samples_leaf = 10
 Classification performance:
🔸Accuracy: ~0.88
🔸F1-score for “good” wines: ~0.75

It includes:

Load & inspect data
Transform target into binary label
Split data + hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
Train model + evaluate (F1-score, accuracy, confusion matrix)
Export textual rules + visualize the decision tree
Save the trained model (.joblib)
